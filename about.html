<p class="medium left">My love of food in general brought life to this website. After mastering my own kitchen during lockdown I wanted to share the simplicity of creating some great dishes from around the world. My journey started during lockdown with cooking my favourite Indian dishes.</p>

<p class="medium left">I have tended to find that a lot of the dishes I create for example like a simple Lasagne always ends up with being fused with some kind of indian spices.</p>

<p class="medium left">Even though I love all types of food from all around the world my focus initially is going to be just Indian food as it is not too difficult for me to make a good curry as long as you have the recipe and the method. My key objective is to provide the recipe in phase 1 of this project. So I guess that this is initially targetting people that already know about cooking and are able to cook a dish based on the ingredients.</p>

<p class="medium left">Please bear with me as once I have completed my research and start to provide cooking instructions you will see the simplicity. You will also learn that by simply changing some of the steps you can alter the taste of the final dish too. An example of this is in the instance of when you marinate meat for a few hours as opossed to cooking it in the same spices.</p>
